# Flasher

A mobile app that displays user-input text in tickertape style, or as flashed-up words in sequence.

The user can choose to display the message once, a set number of times, or continuously on a loop.

The user can choose the speed of the display.

The user can choose the display colour scheme.

Revised plan for 1.0:

- no sound beeps at all (feature now bumped to 2.0)
- toggle between color schemes rather than have a color picker at this stage
- Landscape view will respect the 'Safe Area' of the camera notch
- Font size must adjust dynamically as it does in portrait
- single screen of options
- sense screen size and adjust if required
- all to be done and uploaded and available on the App Store(s) by Thursday 2 May 2024; with lead time for app authorisation, submission by Friday 27 April 2024. 2 weeks and 3 days from now.
